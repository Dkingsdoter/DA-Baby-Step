SDG 5 aims to grant women and girls equal rights and opportunities to live free of violence and discrimination, including the workplace.

# Data Sourcing
The dataset was imported from Kaggle. This dataset includes GII scores, as well as component scores for each indicator, for over 190 countries, in 2021.

# Data Transformation
To ensure our dataset was accurate and reliable , several steps were taken
Step 1: The dataset was filtered in Microsoft Excel to reveal empty rows. The empty rows were identified and deleted. There were 170 countries and 169 distinct values

Step 2: Removing Duplicates: 1 duplicate value was found and removed; 169 unique values remained.

Step 3: All columns were inspected to ensure the number or text formats were correct. Percentages were set up to 2 decimal places.

# Findings and Recommendations
From the indicators above, we can note that countries that rank the highest on the Human Development Index(HDI) have a lower Gender Inequality Index(GII).
An inverse relationship was noticed between the maternal mortality rate and the Human Development Index, where the lower the HDI in the country the higher the mortality rate. 
This emphasizes that in higher HDI areas the higher the level of education, more women rights and access to contraceptives/family planning.
